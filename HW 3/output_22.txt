(1): Best straight-line fit = -1.029(t) + 1.743
(2): Uncertainty in y for the linear fit = 0.609
(3): Uncertainty in B1 = 0.338 and uncertainty in B0 = 0.507
(4): Best quadratic-polynomial fit = 0.182(t^2) - 1.055(t) + 1.327
(5): Uncertainty in y for the polynomial fit = 0.405
(6): Uncertainty in B4 = 0.282, uncertainty in B3 = 0.340, and uncertainty in B2 = 0.820
(8): Uncertainty in y at t = 5 using linear and quadratic fit lines = 4.158
